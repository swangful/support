Believe it or not, again I decided to stick with Ruby because I felt I could best showcase my capabilities and truthfully, most quickly, produce quality results. 

**Things that I used to help DRY up code**
- Cucumber examples table
- Case switch to navigate to game cards
- Debugger that lets you stop and run through steps
- Kept all page object instantiation isolated in App module
- Included the use of built in RSpec matchers

## Environment Setup

1. Clone the repo 
2. Make sure you have command line tools installed `xcode-select --install`
3. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) 
4. If you don't have it already, install Ruby 2.6.3 via rbenv. Make sure you set your version properly after installing.
5. Now we install our gems (basically libraries in Ruby) `bundle install`

## Running tests

**Run cucumber tests using** 
> $ bundle exec cucumber features/_____.feature

I decided to directly hardcode the url in this instance but we could pass it as an environment variable like the other assignment if you wanted too!

## Debugging tests

Just add `binding.pry` anywhere in the steps/page objects.
